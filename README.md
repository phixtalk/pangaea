- #### Architecture Pattern

  MVVM / Repository pattern was used in the architecture of the nodejs application. This pattern emphasizes seperation of concerns and single responsibility design pattern. For example, the controllers delegates tasks to the services, and the services accesses data via the data-access layer. So incase we wish to substitute one data storage for another, it's only a matter of swapping out the data access functions with the a new one that returns data in the same format.

- #### Testing API in Postman

      For POST or PUT requests, you can input data in any of these sections in the body tab
        - raw: JSON
        - x-www-form-urlencoded

- #### Unit Testing

      The following test libraries was used for writing the test cases:
        - chai
        - chai-http
        - mocha
        - jest
